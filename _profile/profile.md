I would describe myself as an Expert Generalist with skills spanning graphic design, multimedia, web design, project leadership, visual communication, user experience, eLearning, online systems, interface design and information architecture. 

Currently I am the Online Learning Technology Leader at Charles Sturt University, where I've also held a variety of roles relating to the implementation, development and production of eLearning resources and systems. Previous to this I spent a number of years in commercial graphic design, working in a variety of roles in print and marketing in Australia and in Europe.

I have a keen interest in innovation as well as developing and implementing new technologies within an educational context to enhance the learning experience. I believe that technology offers a range of unique opportunities to actualise a range of pedagogical and instructional approaches which can revolutionise the education sector. I love the challenge that new technology brings and the creative process involved in developing an idea through to implementation.

Working at the nexus of technology and education I have developed a skill for translating ideas, concepts and goals into technological solutions that improve the user experience. I am a skilled communicator who works especially hard at being able to translate ‘tech speak’ into something tangible and understandable. 

Always open to new opportunities I have been working to establish a broad and international personal learning network and done this by working in the open, engaging in social media, writing academically, presenting at conferences and blogging extensively. At the same time I have become increasingly fluent with leadership responsibilities, large scale projects and team management. I am poised for further change and growth and ready to seize the next big opportunity.
